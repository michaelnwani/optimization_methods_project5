We were provided a text file containing a maze. Each location in the maze is considered a cell (x,y). A cell contains an 'O' if the solver is allowed to occupy the cell. A cell contains an 'X' if the solver is not allowed to occupy the cell. We started at the top left (0,0), and the goal was to get to the cell in the lower right of the maze (rows-1, cols-1). A legal move from a cell is to move up, down, left or right, and not diagonally. Optimization Methods Class, Fall 2012
